**Game of Thrones Twitter Sentiment Analysis:**
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook created by Kaba Haou for the course DSCI 311 at the University of Oregon. The notebook performs sentiment analysis on Twitter data related to the final season of Game of Thrones.

**Overview:**
In this assignment, approximately 20,000 tweets about the final season of Game of Thrones were analyzed. The primary goal was to deconstruct these tweets into individual words and assign a sentiment score to each word using the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) lexicon. VADER is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media, making it ideal for this analysis. The lexicon provides sentiment scores for individual words.

**Requirements:**
To run the Jupyter Notebook, you'll need the following files:

game_of_thrones_tweets.csv: Contains the Twitter data used for analysis.

vader_lexicon.txt: This file contains a list of words along with their polarity scores used by the VADER lexicon for sentiment analysis.

**Note:**
Due to size limitations on GitHub, the game_of_thrones_tweets.csv file and stopwords.txt file cannot be uploaded directly to this repository.
